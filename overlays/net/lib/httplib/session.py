"""Build a configured ``requests.Session`` with retry/backoff, the agent proxy
(credential, kind and ``NO_PROXY`` bypass, all decided in ONE adapter), and
transparent cookie/token load-save + per-host auth.

Cookies and tokens are always chosen by the host of the URL the caller asked
for -- the origin -- never by the proxy's or the gateway's: the jars are read
before the adapter sees the request, the adapter rewrites a COPY, and what
comes back is attributed to the origin again (``response.url``,
``response.request``, ``response.cookies``). A token is a per-request
``Authorization`` header (``Bearer <value>``, or the value verbatim when it
already names a scheme), never a session header, so it cannot leak to another
host; an explicit header or ``auth=`` wins.

URL hooks (``NET_HOOKS_<KEY>`` + ``_PY``, see :mod:`.hooks`) run in the
same place, on the caller's URL, before the request: a hook may log in, set
headers in the request's kwargs, or return a response of its own. A hook
that makes requests through the session does not trigger hooks again.

``requests`` + ``urllib3`` are this toolkit's **optional dependency** (the net
overlay does NOT vendor them — see ``lib/VENDORED.md``). ``new_session`` imports
them lazily and raises a clear, actionable error if they are absent; the curl
shim and the ``certifi`` shim work with zero dependencies regardless.

        * ``NO_PROXY`` hosts go direct, and never see the credential.

        * ``prefix``: the request goes directly to ``<proxy><endpoint><url>`` with
          the credential as a header of that request.

        Every send works on a COPY of the prepared request: requests builds
        redirect hops from the caller's object, so mutating it would carry the
        gateway URL and the credential into the next hop -- which may be a
        ``NO_PROXY`` origin. The response reports the caller's URL, so
