"""Which curl the fallback answers as, where curl versions disagree.

``NET_CURL_COMPAT`` names a curl version (``8.19``, ``8.19.0``) or ``auto``
(the default): the version of the real curl on PATH -- the shim serves a
prefix-gateway request from the fallback even when curl is installed -- else
:data:`NEWEST`. Read lazily: only a version-dependent answer asks for it.

The differences, measured against curl's own builds (8.17-8.22, Windows)
and static Linux builds (8.5-8.17; no 8.6 was measured):

- a proxy refusing the CONNECT: 56 before 8.20, 7 from 8.20 on;
- a response header over curl's limit: 27 ("Out of memory") before 8.6, 100
  from 8.6 on;
- ``%{scheme}`` upper case (``HTTP``) before 8.8; the ports with no
  connection 0 before 8.10 (-1 from 8.10 on);
- ``--proxy-pinnedpubkey`` ignored under ``--proxy-insecure`` before 8.10;
- a ``--netrc-file`` naming no file ignored before 8.12;
- a SOCKS proxy whose name does not resolve: 6 before 8.14, 5 from 8.14 on.

Distributions patch their curl: Ubuntu 24.04's 8.5 answers ``--proto =bogus``
as 8.7 does (a vanilla 8.5 drops the whole token). The fallback follows the
patched one, the 8.5 agents run;
- a ``--cacert`` / ``--netrc-file`` naming no file: refused before anything
  else (exit 2) from 8.18 on; before, the CA file fails at the TLS handshake
  (77) and the netrc file when it is read (26);
- an unknown protocol name in ``--proto`` / ``--proto-redir``: a usage error
  (exit 2) from 8.18 on; before, the name is ignored (its ``=`` / ``-`` still
  applied);
- a ``-w`` variable newer than the version (``WRITE_OUT_SINCE``): a warning
  ("unknown --write-out variable") and nothing written;
- a name a ``socks5://`` / ``socks4://`` proxy needs resolved here and that
  does not resolve: 97 before 8.20 (worded "Could not resolve proxy: <the
  proxy>"), 6 from 8.20 on.

The wording of an output that cannot be written (exit 23 in every version)
was measured on Ubuntu 24.04's 8.5, on 8.18 (Linux) and on 8.21 (Windows, two
builds). The versions between are read from curl's source at its release
tags, not measured:

- a write the destination took only part of: "Failure writing output to
  destination", with ", passed N returned M" from 8.7 on; before 8.7 a header
  line that could not be written is "Failed writing header";
- an output file that cannot be opened: "client returned ERROR on write of N
  bytes" from 8.8 on; in 8.7 the message above with M as 4294967295, before
  that without numbers;
- ``-D -`` to a stdout that is gone: noticed at the first header line from 8.9
  on ("Failed writing headers to -"); before, only when the body is written;
- the tool's own messages, the ones with no exit code ("Failed writing body",
  "Failed to open <file>"): under ``-s`` they are printed with ``-S`` from
  8.17 on, and not at all before; wrapped to the terminal's width from 8.9
  on, to 79 columns before.
