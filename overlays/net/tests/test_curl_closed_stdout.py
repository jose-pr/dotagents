"""An output the fallback cannot write: curl's exit 23, in curl's words.

Run as a child process over a real pipe that the reader closes, and against an
output path that is a directory. curl has several messages for exit 23, and
which one it prints depends on where the write failed: the C library keeps
4096 bytes for a stdout that is not a terminal, so a small body fails only at
the final flush ("Failed writing body") while a larger one fails in the write
itself ("passed N returned M"). The expected text below is what curl 8.18
(Linux) and 8.21 (Windows) print for these invocations; with a real curl
installed, each case is also compared with it line for line.

A failed write leaves Python's stdout unusable, so before this was handled a
later ``-w``, or the flush at interpreter exit, ended the run with a traceback
and exit 120.
